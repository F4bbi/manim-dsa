## Installation

To install Manim DSA, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install manim-dsa
```

If you don't have Manim installed, please refer to the [official Manim documentation](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html) for installation instructions.

## Importing

Simply use the following line of code to import the package:

```py
from manim_dsa import *
```

## Usage

The following is an example `Scene` where an array, a stack and a graph are created.

```python
from manim import *
from manim_dsa import *

class Example(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        graph = {
            'A': [('C', 11), ('D', 7)],
            'B': [('A', 5),  ('C', 3)],
            'C': [('A', 11), ('B', 3)],
            'D': [('A', 7),  ('C', 4)],
        }
        nodes_and_positions = {
            'A': LEFT * 1.5,
            'B': UP * 2,
            'C': RIGHT * 1.5,
            'D': DOWN * 2,
        }

        mArray = (
            MArray([1, 2, 3], style=ArrayStyle.BLUE)
            .add_indexes()
            .scale(0.9)
            .add_label(Text("Array", font="Cascadia Code"))
            .to_edge(LEFT, 1)
        )

        mStack = (
            MStack([3, 7, 98, 1], style=StackStyle.GREEN)
            .scale(0.8)
            .add_label(Text("Stack", font="Cascadia Code"))
            .move_to(ORIGIN)
        )

        mGraph = (
            MGraph(graph, nodes_and_positions, GraphStyle.PURPLE)
            .add_label(Text("Graph", font="Cascadia Code"))
            .to_edge(RIGHT, 1)
        )

        self.play(Create(mArray))
        self.play(Create(mStack))
        self.play(Create(mGraph))
        self.wait()
```
